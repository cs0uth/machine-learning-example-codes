# machine-learning-example-codes
These are some machine learning code examples I've written while learning different algorithms,
Codes are well commented although I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the codes and make it more efficient,
or simplify the code. 
If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at

Further explanation exists for diffrenet codes in each folder.
